# AutoWordscapes
The family was playing Wordscapes, but I'm terrible at word games. Good thing computers are good at word games.

## How it works

1. Run Wordscapes app in android emulator on computer 
2. Take screenshot of screen to locate the circle of letters 
3. Run OCR on the letters 
4. Generate all possible words from the letters 
5. Use mouse to drag letters to input words
6. Repeat 2-5 for all puzzles
